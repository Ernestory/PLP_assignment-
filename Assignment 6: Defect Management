Assignment 6: Defect Management 
 1. What Is Defect Management?

Defect Management is the process of identifying, documenting, prioritizing, tracking, and resolving defects in a software project to ensure high quality.

Purpose:

Maintain software quality

Reduce production issues

Improve customer satisfaction

Provide a structured process for handling defects

 2. The Defect Lifecycle

The Defect Lifecycle (also called Bug Lifecycle) represents the stages a defect goes through from discovery to closure.

Stages:

Identification/Detection:

Defect is discovered by tester, user, or automated tool.

Logging/Recording:

Details about the defect are documented in a defect log.

Classification/Prioritization:

Assign severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial)

Assign priority (High, Medium, Low)

Assignment:

Defect is assigned to the responsible developer or team for fixing.

Resolution/Fixing:

Developer fixes the defect and updates its status.

Verification/Testing:

Tester verifies that the defect is resolved and tests the fix.

Closure:

Defect is marked as Closed if verified, or Reopened if the issue persists.

Tip: Early identification of defects reduces cost and effort significantly.

 3. Importance of Early Defect Identification

Detect defects before deployment

Reduce cost of fixing defects (earlier = cheaper)

Improve software quality and reliability

Minimize impact on users and business operations

Example: Fixing a defect in the design phase costs less than fixing it after production.

 4. Methods of Defect Identification

Static Techniques:

Walkthroughs, reviews, inspections

No execution needed; focuses on documents, design, and code

Dynamic Techniques:

Actual execution of code using functional and non-functional tests

Automated Tools:

Static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint)

Test automation tools (Selenium, JUnit)

User Feedback:

Bugs reported by users during beta or production

Exploratory Testing:

Testers explore the application without predefined test cases

 5. Role of Logging Defects

Defect Logging is documenting defects in a structured format.

Key Elements to Log:

Defect ID

Summary/Title

Description/Steps to reproduce

Severity and Priority

Environment (OS, browser, version)

Reporter name

Date discovered

Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)

Assigned developer

Benefits of Logging:

Tracks defect status and history

Enables analysis of defect trends

Supports better resource allocation

Helps in audit and reporting

 6. Summary

Effective defect management ensures:

Defects are tracked systematically

High-priority defects are addressed first

Software quality is improved continuously

Teams can analyze defects to prevent future issues

Tip: Combine defect lifecycle, early detection, and proper logging for efficient defect management.
