📝 Assignment 3: Static Testing Techniques 
✅ 1. What Is Static Testing?

Static Testing is a method of software testing where the code, project documents, or design are examined without executing the program.

It focuses on finding defects early in the development lifecycle by reviewing artifacts such as:

Requirements documents

Design documents

Source code

Test plans

🔑 Why Static Testing Is Important

Detects errors EARLY (before running the software)

Saves cost and time

Improves software quality

Ensures clarity in requirements and design

Reduces the number of bugs found later during dynamic testing

Examples include walkthroughs, reviews, inspections, and static analysis tools.

✅ 2. Differences Between Walkthroughs, Reviews, and Inspections
🧩 a) Walkthrough

A walkthrough is a presentation of the product by the author (developer, analyst, designer) to a group of peers.

✔ Features:

Led by the author

Used for knowledge sharing

Audience can ask questions

Not very formal

Purpose is understanding, not judging

✔ When Used:

Early drafts of documents

New or complex modules

🧩 b) Technical Review

A technical review is a team-based evaluation of software artifacts to detect defects.

✔ Features:

Moderately formal

Conducted by technical experts

Purpose is to find defects, improve quality

Comments about logic, performance, standards

Author participates but does not lead

✔ Focus:

Code quality

Design correctness

Technology standards

🧩 c) Inspection

Inspection is the most formal static testing technique.

✔ Features:

Led by a trained moderator

Uses checklists

Detailed and structured

Defects are recorded formally

Follow-up is required

Focus on defect detection ONLY (not fixing)

✔ Examples of what inspections check:

Coding standards

Requirements correctness

Design consistency

Logic errors

✨ Difference Summary Table
Feature	Walkthrough	Technical Review	Inspection
Led by	Author	Technical experts	Moderator
Formality	Low	Medium	High
Purpose	Knowledge & feedback	Find defects	Deep defect detection
Uses checklist	No	Sometimes	Yes
Documentation	Optional	Required	Mandatory
✅ 3. Static Analysis Tools

Static analysis tools automatically scan source code to detect potential problems without executing it.

🔧 What They Detect:

Syntax issues

Security vulnerabilities

Dead code

Coding standard violations

Memory leaks (in some languages)

Type mismatches

Potential bugs (e.g. null pointer dereference)

🔍 How They Work

They analyze:

Control flow

Data flow

Code structures

Patterns in logic

Rule violations based on coding standards

⭐ 4. Key Benefits of Using Static Analysis Tools
✔ 1. Early Bug Detection

Finds issues before running the code, reducing cost and rework.

✔ 2. Improved Code Quality

Enforces clean, readable, and maintainable code.

✔ 3. Ensures Compliance with Standards

Helps follow industry coding standards (e.g., MISRA, PEP8).

✔ 4. Reduces Security Risks

Identifies vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.

✔ 5. Saves Time for Testers

Dynamic testing becomes easier because many defects are removed earlier.

✔ 6. Automates Quality Assurance

Useful for CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab).

📌 5. Popular Static Analysis Tools & Their Features
🔹 SonarQube

🔹 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools

Examples: Fortify, Veracode, Checkmarx

Focus on security vulnerabilities

Essential for secure SDLC

🎉 Conclusion

Static testing is a powerful technique used before code execution to:

Improve software quality

Reduce cost

Detect defects early

Enforce coding standards

It includes walkthroughs, reviews, inspections, and static analysis tools, each contributing to making development faster, cleaner, and more reliable.
