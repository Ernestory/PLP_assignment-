Assignment 4: Test Design Techniques — Complete Guide
 1. Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing
 Black-Box Testing

Focuses on what the software does, not how it does it.

Testers don’t need knowledge of internal code.

Test cases are based on requirements and specifications.

Key Features:

Checks functional behavior

Uses techniques like Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Tables, State Transition Testing

Detects missing functions, incorrect outputs, interface errors

⚪ White-Box Testing

Focuses on how the software works internally.

Testers need knowledge of code structure.

Test cases are based on control flow, data flow, and logic.

Key Features:

Checks internal logic and paths

Uses techniques like Statement Coverage, Decision Coverage, Condition Coverage, Path Coverage

Detects logic errors, unreachable code, loops issues


2. Equivalence Partitioning (EP)

Purpose: Reduce the number of test cases by grouping inputs into equivalence classes where all inputs are expected to behave the same way.

Example:

Input: Age for eligibility (0–120 years)

Equivalence Classes:

Valid: 18–60 → Should pass

Invalid: <18 → Should fail

Invalid: >60 → Should fail

Benefit: Testers don’t have to test every single input; testing one value per class is sufficient.

3. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Purpose: Focuses on values at the edges of input ranges, which are more prone to defects.

Example:

Age field (18–60 years)

Test cases: 17, 18, 19, 59, 60, 61

Benefit: Catches edge case errors often missed by normal tests.

4. Decision Tables

Purpose: Represent complex business rules or logic in a table format.

Structure:

Conditions → Columns represent combinations of true/false

Actions → Resulting system behavior

5. State Transition Testing

Purpose: Tests software behavior when moving from one state to another. Useful for systems with defined states like vending machines, login systems, or traffic lights.

Steps:

Identify states

Identify transitions

Define valid and invalid inputs/events

Create test cases for each transition

Example: Login System

States: Logged Out → Logged In → Locked

Transitions: Correct password, wrong password, timeout

Test Cases:

Correct password → Logged In

Wrong password 3 times → Locked

Benefit: Ensures all state changes are tested, including invalid transitions.
